What is Notez Fun?
Notez Fun is an online platform that helps people improve their daily routines, stay organized, and take notes for later. It has three main sections: Todos Chart, Calendar, and Notes.

In Todos Chart, users can add and check tasks, and see the percentage of tasks completed for the day. This progress is reflected in the Calendar with colors like yellow, red, or green depending on completion.

The Notes section lets users pick their mood for the day and add notes, which they can revisit in the future. Notez Fun also includes an AI system powered by an open-source OpenAI model. The AI can answer questions about the platform, suggest todos, fix grammar, and summarize or shorten notes.
